# CODSOFT
Welcome to my Machine Learning Internship Showcase! This repository features the projects I completed during my internship at Codsoft. Each project demonstrates my abilities in data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving, reflecting the knowledge and experience I acquired throughout my internship.

Below is a summary of the projects: 
Task_1. MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION Description: Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. You can use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines. I chose to use Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression..

Task_2. CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION Description: Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Use a dataset containing information about credit card transactions, and experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

Task_3. CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION Description: Develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscription- based service or business. Use historical customer data, including features like usage behavior and customer demographics, and try algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting to predict churn. I have used Logistic Regression.

I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity provided by Codsoft. This experience has been instrumental in enhancing my skills, and I look forward to applying what I have learned to further my expertise in machine learning and data science.
